## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to contribute:

- **Report bugs**: Found something broken? Let us know!
- **Suggest features**: Have an idea for a useful hook or pattern? We'd love to hear it
- **Improve documentation**: Help make our docs clearer
- **Add hooks**: Contribute new hooks for common Designer API patterns
- **Fix issues**: Pick up an issue from our backlog

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- pnpm (`npm install -g pnpm`)
- A Webflow account with access to Designer Extensions

### Setup

1. Fork the repository on GitHub

2. Clone your fork locally:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/webflow-extension-starter.git
   cd webflow-extension-starter
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   pnpm dev
   ```

5. **Test in Webflow**: Open your Webflow Designer and connect your extension (see [README.md](README.md) for details).

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and test thoroughly

3. Run quality checks:

   ```bash
   pnpm type-check  # TypeScript validation
   pnpm check       # Lint check
   pnpm fix         # Auto-fix issues
   ```

4. Commit your changes with a clear message

5. Push to your fork and create a pull request

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

- ✅ Code passes all checks (`pnpm type-check && pnpm check`)
- ✅ Changes build successfully (`pnpm build`)
- ✅ **Template changes tested in Webflow Designer**

### Testing in Webflow Designer

All template changes must be tested in the Webflow Designer before submitting. This includes new or modified hooks, UI changes, and style updates.

1. Run `pnpm dev` to start the development server
2. Open the Webflow Designer with a test project
3. Launch your extension from the apps panel (press **E**)
4. Verify the extension loads and works as expected

### PR Guidelines

1. **Clear conventional title**: Describe what changed (e.g., `feat: add usePageInfo hook`)
2. **Description**: Explain what and why
3. **Confirmation**: Note that you tested in the Webflow Designer
4. **Link issues**: Reference any related issues (e.g., "Fixes #123")

> Use common sense when drafting your pull request. The goal is to make it easy for maintainers to review and merge your changes. Include sufficient details but at the same time avoid unnecessary information.

### Commit Message Guidelines

This project uses [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) to automate changelog and release PRs. Please use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for all commit messages:

- `feat:` for new features (triggers a new release and changelog entry)
- `fix:` for bug fixes (triggers a new release and changelog entry)
- `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc. for other changes (do not trigger a release)

**Examples:**

- `feat: add usePageInfo hook`
- `fix: resolve memory leak in useSelectedElement`
- `chore: update dependencies`

Only `feat:` and `fix:` commits will appear in the changelog and trigger a new release. All other commit types are allowed but will not trigger a release.
